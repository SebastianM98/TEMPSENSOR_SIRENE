# TEMPSENSOR_SIRENE
My project plan is to make a Temperature sensor with a sirene.
If the temperature goes too high, the sirene goes off. 
I use a tweeter speaker as my sirene and a DHT11 sensor for the temperature and humidity.
I also use BLYNK app to show there how the temperature goes.
The BLYNK app is more for the visual, instead of using OLED or LCD or serial monitor.
The app that I use for making the code is arduino.
My micro controller is a ESP32 from JOY-IT.
It uses WiFi to connect with BLYNK.
